The platform provides environment variable management for different deployment environments, allowing for separate configurations for development, staging, and production deployments.

To deploy the frontend to Vercel, first ensure your repository is properly configured with the frontend code in the root directory or specify the correct build directory in the Vercel configuration. Create a `vercel.json` configuration file to customize the deployment settings:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_BASE_URL": "https://your-backend-api.com/api",
    "VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id"
  }
}
```

The deployment process includes automatic optimization of static assets, compression of JavaScript and CSS files, and configuration of appropriate caching headers for optimal performance. Vercel's edge network ensures fast loading times globally, which is crucial for user experience in a financial application.

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NPM_VERSION = "10"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[context.production.environment]
  VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://your-production-api.com/api"
  VITE_ENVIRONMENT = "production"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://your-staging-api.com/api"
  VITE_ENVIRONMENT = "staging"
```

Netlify's build process includes automatic dependency installation, build optimization, and deployment to their global CDN. The platform provides branch-based deployments, allowing for testing of feature branches before merging to production.

#### Netlify Functions for Backend

Deploy the frontend to IPFS by building the static assets and uploading them to the IPFS network. The process involves installing IPFS, adding the built files to the network, and obtaining a content hash that serves as the permanent address for the application.

First, build the frontend application for production:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Then upload to IPFS:

```bash
# Install IPFS
curl -O https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.14.0/go-ipfs_v0.14.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf go-ipfs_v0.14.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd go-ipfs && sudo bash install.sh

# Initialize IPFS
ipfs init

# Start IPFS daemon
ipfs daemon &

# Add frontend files to IPFS
ipfs add -r dist/

# Pin the content to ensure availability
ipfs pin add QmYourContentHash
```

The resulting IPFS hash can be accessed through IPFS gateways or configured with a custom domain using DNS TXT records. This deployment method provides censorship resistance and ensures the platform remains accessible through the distributed IPFS network.

#### IPFS Gateway Configuration

Configure custom domains to point to IPFS content using DNS TXT records:

```
_dnslink.lastwish.example.com. TXT "dnslink=/ipfs/QmYourContentHash"
```

This configuration allows users to access the platform through a traditional domain name while benefiting from IPFS's decentralized hosting. Multiple IPFS gateways can be configured for redundancy and performance optimization.

```motoko
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
import HashMap "mo:base/HashMap";
import Text "mo:base/Text";
import Time "mo:base/Time";

actor LastWish {
  type User = {
    id: Text;
    email: Text;
    firstName: Text;
    lastName: Text;
    createdAt: Int;
  };

  type Document = {
    id: Text;
    userId: Text;
    documentType: Text;
    content: Text;
    createdAt: Int;
  };

  private stable var userEntries : [(Text, User)] = [];
  private stable var documentEntries : [(Text, Document)] = [];

  private var users = HashMap.fromIter<Text, User>(
    userEntries.vals(), userEntries.size(), Text.equal, Text.hash
  );

  private var documents = HashMap.fromIter<Text, Document>(
    documentEntries.vals(), documentEntries.size(), Text.equal, Text.hash
  );

  public func createUser(email: Text, firstName: Text, lastName: Text) : async Text {
    let userId = generateId();
    let user : User = {
      id = userId;
      email = email;
      firstName = firstName;
      lastName = lastName;
      createdAt = Time.now();
    };
    users.put(userId, user);
    userId
  };

  public func generateDocument(userId: Text, documentType: Text, content: Text) : async ?Text {
    switch (users.get(userId)) {
      case null { null };
      case (?user) {
        let documentId = generateId();
        let document : Document = {
          id = documentId;
          userId = userId;
          documentType = documentType;
          content = content;
          createdAt = Time.now();
        };
        documents.put(documentId, document);
        ?documentId
      };
    }
  };

  private func generateId() : Text {
    Int.toText(Time.now())
  };

  system func preupgrade() {
    userEntries := users.entries() |> Iter.toArray(_);
    documentEntries := documents.entries() |> Iter.toArray(_);
  };

  system func postupgrade() {
    userEntries := [];
    documentEntries := [];
  };
}
```

This Motoko implementation provides the core backend functionality while running entirely on the Internet Computer blockchain, ensuring true decentralization and censorship resistance.

### Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Integration

Integrate ENS domains to provide human-readable addresses for the decentralized deployment. ENS domains can point to IPFS content, ICP canisters, or traditional hosting while providing a consistent brand identity.
